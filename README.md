# Digit Recognition using Tensorflow.js

### Used a convolutional neural net to train a model on MNIST handwritten numbers dataset

### Used tf-vis to visualize the training process with loss and accuracy as parameters

### Finally created a confusion matrix to represent each class and its prediction probability.






## How to run:

### Clone or download the files
### Open index.html in browser

	firefox index.html

### or

	google-chrome index.html






## 'Cross-Origin XMLHttpRequest' 

### The easy fix to this problem is host a local server, if you have python on your machine: 

	python -m http.server

### run this in the folder, this automatically executes the index.html file
